Starbeam is a new kind of reactive library. It makes reactive programming simple and fun, and ==it
works with your existing JavaScript framework==.

- **Use normal JavaScript APIs and access patterns.** Build reactive data structures using reactive
  versions of JavaScript built-ins like objects, arrays, maps, and sets, and update them exactly as
  you would with normal JavaScript.
- **No delays.** Updates to reactive values **take effect immediately**. Your reactive data and
  computations are always coherent, just like normal JavaScript.
- **Works everywhere.** You don't need to learn a new framework to take advantage of Starbeam's cutting
  edge reactive system. You can render Starbeam data using renderers designed for your framework of
  choice, or even build your own renderer.
- **TypeScript types are a first-class consideration.** Every part of Starbeam's API was designed
  from the ground up using TypeScript types with careful attention to the details. And if you're not
  a TypeScript user, you can still get the benefit in normal JavaScript code through inline
  suggestions, documentation and tab completion in your editor, no configuration needed.

::: warning

This documentation is a work in progress. We are making quick progress (and would love your help!).

We're still writing many areas of the documentation, building examples, and fixing mistakes. But if
you're ready for an adventure, come on in and join the fun!
