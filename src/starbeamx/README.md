# @starbeamx

`@starbeamx` is a collection of optional extensions built on Starbeam reactivity.

Unlike the core Starbeam functionality and renderers, we don't expect every app to use these
extensions. That said, they work well with Starbeam reactivity and we expect them to be broadly
useful.

- [@starbeamx/store]: A table-oriented store for application data with support for sorting,
  filtering, grouping and aggregation.
- [@starbeamx/vanilla]: An experimental renderer for Starbeam without any framework.
