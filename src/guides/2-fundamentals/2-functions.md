# Functions

Once you have some cells, you can compute values based on those cells using normal functions.

;;; ./$snippets/functions.ts#simple-function

And then use the function as normal.

;;; ./$snippets/functions.ts#use-as-normal

You can also pass cells into functions as arguments.

;;; ./$snippets/functions.ts#cells-as-arguments

And then use the function as normal.

;;; ./$snippets/functions.ts#use-cell-arguments-as-normal
