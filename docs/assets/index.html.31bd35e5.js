Your reactive data and computations are always coherent, just like normal JavaScript.</li><li><strong>Works everywhere.</strong> You don&#39;t need to learn a new framework to take advantage of Starbeam&#39;s cutting edge reactive system. You can render Starbeam data using renderers designed for your framework of choice, or even build your own renderer.</li><li><strong>TypeScript types are a first-class consideration.</strong> Every part of Starbeam&#39;s API was designed from the ground up using TypeScript types with careful attention to the details. And if you&#39;re not a TypeScript user, you can still get the benefit in normal JavaScript code through inline suggestions, documentation and tab completion in your editor, no configuration needed.</li></ul><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>This documentation is a work in progress.
