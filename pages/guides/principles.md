# Guiding Principles

::: info Starbeam's Core Principle
If you model your reactive data like any other data, you can build reliable reactive UIs with the skills you already have.

::: philosophy
**We believe that reactive programming should feel exactly like regular programming.**
:::

Reactive UI frameworks have a way of describing reactive inputs and a way of describing an output in terms of those inputs, which the framework automatically keeps up to date.

**Starbeam's** APIs for input data are annotated versions of normal JavaScript data structures, and you use normal JavaScript functions for all of your computation.
